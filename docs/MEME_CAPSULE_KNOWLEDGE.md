          MEME CAPSULE — CORE PRODUCT QUESTIONS & AUTHORITATIVE ANSWERS
================================================================================
```

### Q1: What is Meme Capsule?
**Meme Capsule** is an anti-algorithm, single-action meme delivery platform engineered for immediate entertainment without feeds, doomscrolling, or social clutter.
- **Public Mobile Product:** A native Android application (`com.meme.capsule`, current version `v2.7` / `versionCode 18`) available on Google Play. Built with React 19, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS v4, and Capacitor 8, it operates like a digital arcade vending machine: tapping the **`HIT ME`** button dispenses exactly one hand-screened, high-variance meme onto a 4-card 3D perspective spring stack.
- **Public Web Platform:** A multi-page, statically prerendered web platform at [https://memecapsule.wtf](https://memecapsule.wtf) featuring a live interactive drop preview simulator (with a 5-drop quota and Google Play install bumper), 3D interactive phone mockups with authentic WebP screenshots, Section 04.5 "Under the Hood" technical transparency, an official `/about` Press Kit, and Google AdSense monetization (`meme1`).
- **Developer / Serverless Edge Backend:** A serverless edge architecture on Cloudflare Pages (`https://meme-capsule-eww.pages.dev`), Cloudflare D1 (SQLite database), and Cloudflare R2 (media bucket), coupled with Neo-Brutalist internal tools for human multi-judge curation (`/curate`), admin database syncing (`/admin`), user safety moderation (`/reports`), and AI-assisted pre-evaluation (`/ai-judge`).

### Q2: Why does Meme Capsule exist?
Modern internet culture is trapped inside social media feeds (Instagram, TikTok, X, Reddit) controlled by recommendation algorithms that optimize for watch time, outrage, repetitive trends, and sponsored posts. Users spend 45 minutes doomscrolling just to encounter two genuinely funny memes. Meme Capsule was created to restore the original magic of internet humor: instant, surprise-driven, zero-friction entertainment with no tracking, no accounts, and no algorithmic manipulation.

### Q3: What problem is it trying to solve?
1. **Algorithmic Fatigue & Doomscrolling:** Eliminates feed-induced sensory overload and screen addiction by replacing continuous vertical scroll with deliberate, discrete single-capsule drops.
2. **Quality Dilution & Repost Slop:** Fixes the low-effort repost problem by curating memes through a multi-stage pipeline: staging via Google Drive, automated multimodal AI pre-judging (Gemini Vision and NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 Vision), human multi-judge consensus, SuperAdmin arbitration, and community reporting.
3. **Saving & Sharing Friction:** Cleanly saving a meme on Android usually requires taking a screenshot, cropping black bars, or dealing with intrusive app watermarks. Meme Capsule features native Android MediaStore integration for instant, lossless 1-tap gallery saving without permission prompts, alongside a custom Neo-Brutalist Share Sheet with 6 animated social media dispatch buttons.
4. **Friction & Privacy Intrusion:** Eliminates logins, passwords, tracking cookies, and profile creation. The user opens the app or website and is instantly one tap away from humor.

### Q4: Who is Meme Capsule for?
- **Digital Natives & Group Chat Instigators (Gen Z & Millennials, Ages 18–28):** Users whose primary goal is finding fresh, non-stale memes to share directly into WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and Instagram group chats before anyone else sees them.
- **Micro-Break Seekers (Ages 18–35):** Students, commuters, and software engineers who want a quick, punchy 30-second dopamine reset during code builds, transit rides, or study breaks without falling into a 45-minute doomscroll trap.
- **Meme Collectors & Curators:** Users who organize personal collections into categorized, color-coded **Mood Boards** ("Pinned Energy") for situational deployment.
- **Casual Android & Web Users:** Anyone seeking clean, ad-light humor with zero personal data extraction.

### Q5: How does Meme Capsule work?
1. **Public Mobile Flow:**
   - The user opens the app and sees an arcade-inspired neo-brutalist interface with a prominent central button: **HIT ME**.
   - Tapping `HIT ME` pops the next meme instantly from a 7-meme FIFO prefetch buffer while showing an arcade hacker decryption sequence.
   - The meme is presented on an interactive 4-card 3D perspective spring stack (`@react-spring/web` & `@use-gesture/react`). The user can Swipe Right (`keep`), Swipe Left (`skip`), Swipe Up (`save`), Double-Tap (`DANK!` shake + reaction stamp), or Long-Press for 600ms to download to their gallery.
   - Instant-touch overlay buttons (`38px × 38px` Download & Share on top-right, `34px × 34px` Report on bottom-right) and a 4-button CTA bar (**LIKE**, **VAULT**, **PIN**, **SHARE**) provide immediate one-tap utility.
   - Tapping **SHARE** opens the Neo-Brutalist Share Bottom Sheet with live thumbnail preview, an auto-attached promotional message with Google Play Store download link, and 6 animated social media SVG dispatch buttons (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, X, Telegram, Discord).
2. **Public Web Flow (`memecapsule.wtf`):**
   - Visitors explore an authentic live drop preview simulator with a 5-drop quota counter. After 5 drops, a conversion lockout bumper prompts Google Play app installation with UTM campaign tracking.
   - Visitors can tilt 3D interactive phone mockups showcasing real WebP screenshots, open a full-resolution lightbox zoom modal, review technical breakdowns under Section 04.5 "Under the Hood", access the official Press Kit on `/about`, and consult an expanded 15-question FAQ.
3. **Internal Backend Flow:**
   - Unreviewed memes ingested into Cloudflare D1 and R2 storage are assigned `status = 'archived'`, `is_active = 0`, and `curation_status = NULL` (Uncurated Backlog).
   - Human curators review memes in `/curate` using Layer 0 keyboard shortcuts (`K` Keep, `E` Exclude, `D` Duplicate, `L` Review Later).
   - Divergent judge votes surface in the SuperAdmin Command Center. ONLY memes authoritatively resolved as `keep` become `ACTIVE` (`status = 'active'`, `is_active = 1`, `curation_status = 'keep'`) and eligible for public capsule drops; rejected memes are strictly isolated under `curation_status = 'excluded'`.

### Q6: What are all of its major features?
- **Single-Tap Capsule Dispenser:** Discrete random meme delivery with zero feed or scroll.
- **4-Card 3D Perspective Stack:** Spring-physics gesture deck supporting Swipe Left/Right/Up, Double-Tap haptics, and Long-Press downloads.
- **7-Meme FIFO Background Prefetch Buffer:** Maintains 7 preloaded memes in memory for zero loading delay.
- **Hybrid Content Sourcing:** Cloudflare D1/R2 repository alternating every 3rd fetch (`totalMemesViewed % 3 === 0`) with Reddit (`meme-api.com/gimme`), strictly filtered for SFW non-spoiler media.
- **Instant-Touch Overlay Buttons:** `38px × 38px` Download & Share buttons executing on `onPointerDown`/`onTouchStart` with debounce guards to prevent gesture conflicts.
- **Neo-Brutalist Viral Share Bottom Sheet:** Custom bottom sheet featuring live thumbnail preview, auto-attached Play Store download message, 6 animated social media SVG logos, QuickShare, More Options (#FF8C00 native chooser), and clipboard copy.
- **Native MediaStore Downloader:** Custom Java bridge saving memes into `Pictures/Meme Capsule` with zero runtime storage permissions on Android 10+.
- **Targeted Social Share Intent Bridge:** `shareImageToApp()` targeting specific package names with automatic fallback to native chooser.
- **Meme Vault & Mood Boards:** Local offline favorites gallery (free tier limit 20, Pro unlimited) and color-coded themed binders ("Pinned Energy") with synchronized pinboard/favorites storage.
- **Arcade Hacker Decryption Console:** Terminal animations, erratic countdowns, and diagnostic logs (`CHECKING REDDIT RELAY...`, `HARVESTING D1 SHARDS...`).
- **Interactive Web Live Preview:** Web simulator on `memecapsule.wtf` with 5-drop quota counter, automated fallback recovery, and Google Play install bumper.
- **3D Interactive Phone Mockups:** 5 authentic Android app screenshots in modern WebP + JPEG format with mouse-tilt 3D physics and fullscreen lightbox zoom.
- **Kage-Inspired Atmospheric Web UI:** Preloader animation, magnetic circular cursor, GPU-accelerated film grain overlay, vignette shading, and desktop scroll rail.
- **Cyberpunk Acid Glitch Mode:** High-saturation chromatic aberration theme toggle with CRT scanlines.
- **Section 04.5 Under the Hood:** Technical transparency section detailing the 5,000+ meme library, Reddit feed safety mechanics, and zero-tracking privacy architecture.
- **Expanded 15-Question FAQ:** Search-optimized accordion backed by `FAQPage` Schema.org JSON-LD markup.
- **Dedicated About & Press Kit (`/about`):** Entity definition, quick facts grid, one-liner copy kit with copy-to-clipboard buttons, and downloadable brand assets.
- **Google AdMob & AdSense Monetization:** Mobile interstitial ads every 4th meme + rewarded ads for bonus drops; web banner ad unit `meme1` (`slot 6291908699`, `ca-pub-2093403233028868`).
- **Pro Tier In-App Purchase:** One-time upgrade (`remove_ads_forever` via `@capgo/native-purchases`) unlocking Zero Ads, Unlimited Vault, and permanent Triple Drop access.
- **Multi-Judge Consensus & SuperAdmin Arbitration:** Human curation engine (`/curate`) with Layer 0 keyboard navigation and binding consensus arbitration.
- **3-Tier D1 Status Partitioning (Migration 012):** Explicit separation of Active Capsule (111), Superadmin Excluded (53), and Uncurated Backlog (4,947) across database, APIs, and `/admin` UI.
- **Admin Control Panel & SQL Runner (`/admin`):** 5-metric top stats bar, dedicated `[EXCLUDED]` filter tab, R2 binary uploads, R2-to-D1 sync, and analytics recalculation.
- **Token-Gated Safety Moderation (`/reports`):** Ingestion of user-flagged content (`POST /api/report`) with one-click soft-archival and `content_blacklist` enforcement.
- **Multimodal AI Pre-Curator Loop (`/ai-judge`):** Gemini Vision and Python NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 11B Vision pipeline categorizing humor mechanisms, topics, and safety.

### Q7: How is it technically built?
- **Mobile Native Wrapper:** Android app built with **Capacitor 8** wrapping a Vite 6 / React 19 SPA, extended with a custom Java native bridge (`MainActivity.java`).
- **Mobile Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Vite 6.2, Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`), `@react-spring/web`, `@use-gesture/react`.
- **Web Platform & Pre-rendering:** React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS v3, React Router DOM v6, static HTML pre-rendering via `vite-plugin-prerender` with deterministic `ReactSSRRenderer` for GitHub Actions CI.
- **Edge Backend:** **Cloudflare Pages Functions** running on V8 isolates with zero cold-start latency (`functions/api/*`, `functions/reports.ts`).
- **Database:** **Cloudflare D1** (serverless SQLite at the edge) with 13 production migrations.
- **Media Storage:** **Cloudflare R2** (S3-compatible object storage with **$0.00 egress fees**).
- **AI Evaluation Pipeline:** Multimodal Gemini Vision (`@google/genai`) on Cloudflare Functions and an offline Python runner executing **NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct**.
- **SEO / GEO / AEO:** 4 linked Schema.org JSON-LD entities (`WebSite`, `Organization`, `MobileApplication`, `FAQPage`), `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` protocols for frontier AI crawlers, and XML Sitemap.

### Q8: How does its backend work?
The backend is completely serverless. When a client calls `GET /api/random-meme`, a Cloudflare Pages Function queries Cloudflare D1 with an inner join on `meme_curation_final`:
```sql
SELECT m.* FROM memes m
INNER JOIN meme_curation_final f ON m.id = f.meme_id
WHERE m.is_active = 1 AND m.status = 'active' AND f.corpus_status = 'keep' AND m.random_key >= ?
ORDER BY m.random_key ASC LIMIT 1;
```
Any meme that is unfinalized, in judging, or excluded is mathematically impossible to retrieve via `/api/random-meme` or `/api/daily-meme`. Media assets are served directly from Cloudflare R2 via an edge CDN URL with global caching and zero egress charges.

### Q9: How does its AI system work?
- **Public Product:** **ZERO AI RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHMS.** Content delivery is randomized serendipity.
- **Internal Backend Pipeline:**
  1. Multimodal Gemini Vision (`gemini-1.5-flash`) powers `/api/ai-judge/classify.ts` for rapid in-dashboard pre-evaluation.
  2. An asynchronous Python pipeline (`categorise.py`) inspects raw memes in R2 using **NVIDIA NIM (Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct)**. It performs multimodal OCR, evaluates humor mechanisms (irony, absurdity, relatability), assigns topics and tone, flags NSFW or low-effort content, and outputs structured metadata that populates D1 for human superadmin approval.

### Q10: What makes the application different?
1. **Discrete Consumption vs. Infinite Loop:** One button and one capsule at a time. The deliberate absence of a feed forces focus onto a single punchline and gives users total control over their time.
2. **Neo-Brutalist Arcade Visuals:** Pitch-dark `#131313` background, high-voltage purple (`#9b30ff`), arcade gold (`#f4c300`), hot magenta pink (`#dd0061`), 2-4px solid black borders, and hard geometric offset drop shadows.
3. **Lossless Native Android Integration:** Custom Java bridge to `MediaStore` saving memes directly into `Pictures/Meme Capsule` without browser download prompts or watermarks, plus targeted intent sharing to WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, and Discord.
4. **Radical Technical Transparency:** Explains exactly how memes are fetched, curated, and stored directly on the website with zero corporate obfuscation.
5. **Zero-Account Privacy:** No user accounts, passwords, or tracking cookies.

## 3. PART A: PUBLIC MOBILE APPLICATION (`com.meme.capsule`)

### 3.1 Product Identity, Philosophy & Vision
The mobile app rejects infinite feed algorithms. It is designed as an **Arcade Vending Machine for Internet Humor**:
- **One Interaction:** Tapping `HIT ME` dispenses one curated meme.
- **Finite Gratification:** Enjoy a discrete laugh, react, share, and exit.
- **Anti-Algorithm:** Random serendipity replaces recommendation algorithms.
- **Privacy by Default:** Zero tracking, zero profiles, zero mandatory accounts.

### 3.2 Target Users, Personas & Core Scenarios
1. **The Group Chat Instigator (18–28 yrs):** Needs fresh meme ammunition for WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Instagram group chats. Uses instant-touch buttons, auto-attached Play Store share links, and native targeted social sharing.
2. **The Micro-Breaker (18–35 yrs):** Takes a 30-second break between tasks. Opens Meme Capsule, pops 3 capsules, laughs, and locks the phone.
3. **The Meme Collector:** Organizes top gems into themed Mood Boards ("Tech Pain", "Workplace Chaos") for quick situational replies.

### 3.3 Complete End-User Feature Inventory (v2.7 / VersionCode 18)

Non-intrusive AdMob interstitial every 4th meme (suppressed if `hasAdsRemoved()`). |

### 3.4 Card Deck, Gestures & Instant-Touch Overlay Architecture
The card deck is orchestrated by `MemeStack.tsx` using `@react-spring/web` and `@use-gesture/react`:
- **3D Perspective Deck:** Renders up to 4 stacked cards with dynamic scale, z-index, and perspective offsets.
- **Swipe Gestures:**
  - *Swipe Right:* Casts a `keep` vote and triggers the next card.
  - *Swipe Left:* Casts a `skip` vote.
  - *Swipe Up:* Saves the meme directly to the user's Meme Vault.
- **Double-Tap Reaction:** Double-tapping anywhere on the active card triggers a haptic recoil shake (`.animate-shake`) and stamps a visual reaction tag (`DANK!`, `CRINGE!`, `SO REAL`).
- **600ms Long-Press:** Holding down on the card executes a direct gallery download via the native Java bridge.
- **Instant-Touch Overlay Buttons (`MemeCard.tsx`):**
  - Because `MemeStack` attaches gesture handlers to the card with `touch-action: none`, standard click events can be swallowed during drag initiation.
  - The top-right `38px × 38px` Download & Share buttons and the bottom-right `34px × 34px` Report button execute on `onPointerDown` / `onTouchStart` with a `useRef` timestamp guard (250ms debounce) and `pointer-events-none` on inner SVG icons so touches register on the very first contact.

### 3.5 Neo-Brutalist Viral Share Bottom Sheet & Social Dispatch System
When the user taps Share (from the card overlay, bottom CTA bar, Meme Vault, or Mood Boards), the app opens `ShareModal.tsx`:
1. **Payload & Promotional Message Preview:**
   - Displays a live meme thumbnail, `1 Image + Invite Link` tag, `HD` stamp, and a dedicated preview box showing the exact message and Play Store link:
     ```text
     💊 Caught this wild drop on MEME CAPSULE! 🔥
     "<Meme Title>"

     📲 Download Meme Capsule on Google Play:
     https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meme.capsule
     ```
2. **6 Animated Social Media Dispatch Buttons (`QUICK DISPATCH`):**
   - **WhatsApp** (`com.whatsapp`) — Animated ringing/pulsing SVG logo (`mc-anim-whatsapp`).
   - **Instagram** (`com.instagram.android`) — Animated rotating/glowing camera SVG logo (`mc-anim-insta`).
   - **Facebook** (`com.facebook.katana`) — Animated floating emblem SVG logo (`mc-anim-fb`).
   - **X (Twitter)** (`com.twitter.android`) — Animated kinetic slash SVG logo (`mc-anim-x`).
   - **Telegram** (`org.telegram.messenger`) — Animated soaring paper-plane SVG logo (`mc-anim-tg`).
   - **Discord** (`com.discord`) — Animated wobbling Clyde controller SVG logo (`mc-anim-discord`).
3. **QuickShare & More Options (`MORE OPTIONS`):**
   - Features a prominent `#FF8C00` tangerine button with an animated dots icon that immediately opens the native Android system share sheet (`Intent.createChooser`).
4. **Copy to Clipboard:**
   - Copies the promotional text, Play Store link, and image URL to the clipboard with tactile visual confirmation (`COPIED TO CLIPBOARD! ⚡`).

### 3.6 Native Android Bridge & Scoped MediaStore Storage (`MainActivity.java`)
Registered on the Android WebView as `window.MemeCapsuleAndroid`:
- **`downloadImage(String url, String fileName)`**:
  - Streams the image on a background thread into `Pictures/Meme Capsule` via Android 10+ `MediaStore.Images.Media` (`IS_PENDING` atomic write), eliminating the need for legacy storage permissions on modern Android devices.
- **`shareImage(String url, String fileName, String title)`**:
  - Formats `title` using `buildShareMessage(title)` so the Play Store link is always included, caches the image in `getCacheDir()/shared_images/` via `FileProvider`, and opens the native share chooser.
- **`shareImageToApp(String url, String fileName, String shareText, String targetPackage)`**:
  - Downloads the meme image into `FileProvider` cache (`content://com.meme.capsule.fileprovider/...`), attaches both `Intent.EXTRA_STREAM` (image URI + `ClipData`) and `Intent.EXTRA_TEXT` (promotional message + Play Store link).
  - Attempts to launch the target app directly via `targetedIntent.setPackage(targetPackage)`. If the target app is not installed on the device, it seamlessly falls back to `Intent.createChooser` so sharing never fails.
  - Supported package queries are declared in `AndroidManifest.xml` (`<queries>` for WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, Discord).

### 3.7 Meme Vault, Mood Boards ("Pinned Energy") & Offline Collections
- **Meme Vault:** Persistent offline favorites list stored in `localStorage('meme_favorites')` with instant client-side search. Free tier users can save up to 20 memes (`FREE_VAULT_LIMIT = 20`); Pro users have unlimited storage.
- **Mood Boards ("Pinned Energy"):** Color-coded thematic binders (`primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`) created via `CreateBoardModal.tsx`.
- **Pinboard Synchronization:** When a meme is pinned to a board, the system synchronizes both `meme_pinboard` and `meme_favorites` records to guarantee that pinned meme thumbnails always render reliably even if the meme was not previously saved to the main vault.

### 3.8 Mobile Monetization (AdMob + Google Play In-App Purchases & Neo-Brutalist Store)
- **Google AdMob:**
  - Non-intrusive full-screen interstitial ad displayed every 4th meme viewed via `@capacitor-community/admob`. Suppressed permanently if `hasAdsRemoved()`.
  - Rewarded ads allow users to unlock optional bonus drops or temporary +1 session Mood Board slots. Rewarded ads remain fully optional even for users who purchased No Ads.
- **Neo-Brutalist In-App Capsule Store (`src/components/store/`):**
  - Full-screen game-style overlay opened via `openStore({ focus?: ProductId })`.
  - **Clash of Clans Horizontal Game Store Architecture:**
    - Top sticky category jump bar: `[★ FEATURED]`, `[BUNDLES]`, `[PASSES]`, `[THEMES]`, `[PACKS]`, `[ACCOUNT]` with live active indicator tracking scroll position. Tapping any pill smoothly scrolls horizontally to that category.
    - Lateral swipe physics with `snap-x snap-mandatory` and `snap-start`: cards are arranged horizontally with fixed game-proportions (`w-[275px]` to `w-[305px]`), allowing adjacent cards to peek from the right edge on mobile viewports (~360px-412px) to entice lateral browsing.
    - Category shelves: Featured Hero (Capsule Max), Value Bundles (4), Permanent Passes (3), Colour Themes (4 with 8s preview), Drop Mode Packs (4), Play Store Account & QA (1).
  - **QA Testing Mode & Free Feature Verification:**
    - Reference pricing fallback (`FALLBACK_PRODUCTS` in `billing.ts`): ensures prices are always formatted and displayed (`₹149`, `₹79`, etc.) on sideloaded APKs or test environments without requiring live Play Console activation.
    - Simulated test unlock (`testPurchase(productId)`): allows immediate testing of all paid unlocks and bundle celebrations without Google Play Billing errors.
    - Free tier reset (`resetTestPurchases()`): one-tap button wipes all entitlements so testers can verify 100% of the free experience (Mood Boards 3-cap, default theme, classic FX, ads).
    - Rewarded ad fallback in `App.tsx`: ensures testing the free Mood Board +1 session slot works reliably even if native AdMob test video fill is unavailable.
  - Catalog (`src/monetization/catalog.ts`): Single source of truth containing 11 single unlocks and 5 bundles:
    - **Single Unlocks:** `remove_ads_forever` (NO ADS), `unlimited_mood_boards` (BOARD BOSS), `fx_arcade_pack` (ARCADE FX), 4 colour themes (`theme_cyberpunk_cyan`, `theme_acid_green`, `theme_midnight_gold`, `theme_blood_orange`), and 4 drop mode packs (`pack_dark_humour`, `pack_wholesome`, `pack_desi`, `pack_gaming` - marked `available: false` / COMING SOON pending backend category endpoint).
    - **Bundles:** `bundle_starter` (Starter Pack), `bundle_style` (Drip Pack), `bundle_meme_lovers` (Meme Head Pack), `meme_capsule_pro` (Capsule Pro), `bundle_ultimate` (Capsule Max).
    - **Rarity Tiers:** Common (`#988ca1`), Rare (`#9b30ff`), Epic (`#dd0061`), Legendary (`#f4c300`).
  - **Billing Engine (`@capgo/native-purchases` v8.8.1):**
    - Displays live formatted prices from Google Play (`priceString`) with catalog reference fallback (`FALLBACK_PRODUCTS`) on test builds.
    - Live savings badge computed dynamically: `1 - (bundlePrice / sum(componentPrices))`. Hidden if any component price is missing.
    - Automatic purchase acknowledgement for all one-time non-consumable products to prevent Google Play 3-day refunds.
    - Silent cancellation handling (zero intrusive error toasts on cancel).
    - Pending payment tracking (UPI/cash delays show `PAYMENT PENDING` and reconcile on app resume / foreground).
    - `restorePurchases()` re-queries Google Play INAPP purchases directly with `PURCHASES RESTORED` or `NOTHING TO RESTORE` toasts.
  - **Entitlements System (`src/monetization/entitlements.ts`):**
    - Single source of truth: `useEntitlements()` hook backed by `EntitlementsContext` and cached in `localStorage`.
    - Union-based grants model: owning a bundle automatically expands to grant all component product IDs and entitlement keys.
    - Direct grant/revoke/reset helpers: `grantProductDirectly`, `revokeProductDirectly`, `resetAllEntitlements` for seamless QA toggling.
    - Offline resilience: persists last verified ownership snapshot; only revokes if an online Play query confirms refund/revocation.
    - Auto-reverts equipped cosmetics (themes, FX) to classic defaults if access is revoked.
  - **Interactive Features:**
    - 8-second temporary theme preview with countdown banner and auto-revert.
    - Neo-Brutalist celebratory slam animation (`PurchaseCelebration.tsx`) on purchase confirmation.
    - Honest bundle partial ownership warnings: "YOU ALREADY OWN N OF M ITEMS".
    - 4 selectable Arcade FX styles: Classic, Retro Slam, Neon Glitch, Cassette Pop.
    - Drop Mode selector with niche filters next to HIT ME button.

### 3.9 Mobile Safety, Age Verification (DOB) & Content Reporting
- **First-Launch Date of Birth (DOB) Verification Modal (`DateOfBirthModal.tsx`):**
  - Integrated into the app flow and presented immediately **after the Onboarding Guide** on first download/install before entering the main card deck.
  - Mandatory full-screen modal (`z-[2000]`) non-bypassable: cannot be closed, skipped, or dismissed via backdrop click, Escape key, or Android hardware back navigation.
  - Auto-advancing Neo-Brutalist DD / MM / YYYY numerical inputs with numeric keypad, coupled with an optional native Android DatePicker calendar dialog.
  - Zero-Knowledge Client-Side Evaluation: DOB is evaluated entirely on-device and never sent to the backend. In accordance with zero-tracking privacy principles, users 18+ have the option to unlock an NSFW content filter in App Settings. When enabled by an adult user, the mobile app passes `?nsfw=1` to public backend delivery endpoints (`/api/random-meme`, `/api/daily-meme`). For users under 18 or when toggled off, requests omit the parameter and the backend defaults strictly to safe/filtered memes (`is_nsfw = 0`).
  - Single-entry locked: once submitted, the DOB is saved to `localStorage('meme_capsule_user_dob')` alongside `meme_capsule_dob_confirmed_at` and can never be re-input or edited.
  - Displayed as a verified, locked badge in App Settings under "PRIVACY, LEGAL & ABOUT".
  - Canonical initial onboarding sequence: `Privacy Policy Consent -> Onboarding Guide -> Date of Birth Modal (18+) -> Main Home Deck`.
- **Reporting Modal (`ReportModal.tsx`):** Users can report inappropriate content (`NSFW`, `Hate Speech`, `Harassment`, `Copyright`).
- **Immediate Local Suppression:** Submitting a report triggers `POST /api/report` to Cloudflare Pages and immediately adds the meme ID to `localStorage('reported_memes')`. The client filtering loop (`fetchValidMeme()`) permanently drops reported memes from subsequent card drops.

### 3.10 Google Play Store In-App Rating & Review Engine (`RatingModal.tsx`)
To drive organic Google Play Store reviews while honoring the app's Neo-Brutalist design language and respectful UX philosophy:
- **Eligibility & Periodic Trigger Logic (`checkRatingPromptEligibility` in `src/App.tsx`):**
  - Evaluated on card deck transitions (`totalMemesViewed`).
  - **Suppression Gates:** Suppressed permanently if feedback was already registered (`localStorage('meme_capsule_rating_completed') === 'true'`).
  - **Active Session Safety:** Never opens while other modals are active (Onboarding, DOB gate, Report modal, Unpin dialog, Mood board composer, Store overlay, or active Rewarded Ad).
  - **Snooze Check:** Suppressed if the user deferred within the past 24 hours (`localStorage('meme_capsule_rating_deferred_until') > Date.now()`).
  - Triggers after an initial viewing threshold (e.g. 15 memes) and periodically re-checks at spaced intervals.
- **Neo-Brutalist Visual Design:**
  - Strict palette adherence: background `#1c1b1b` / `#131313`, gold border `#f4c300`, solid offset shadow (`shadow-[8px_8px_0px_0px_#f4c300]`), zero border radius, Anton & Oswald typography.
  - Interactive 5-star reaction selector with dynamic feedback badges:
    - 5 Stars: `GOD-TIER DANKNESS! 🔥` (`#FACC15`)
    - 4 Stars: `CERTIFIED BANGERS! ⚡` (`#00E5FF`)
    - 3 Stars: `SOLID CHUCKLES 👌` (`#34C759`)
    - 2 Stars: `NEEDS MORE SPICE 🫠` (`#FF9800`)
    - 1 Star: `MID CORP SLOP 💀` (`#FF3B30`)
- **Direct Play Store Dispatch (`redirectToPlayStore`):**
  - First attempts to call the native Java bridge: `window.MemeCapsuleAndroid.openPlayStoreListing()`.
  - Automatically falls back to opening `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meme.capsule` via `window.open` with `noopener,noreferrer`.
- **24-Hour Snooze Deferral:**
  - Clicking `[X]` or `SNOOZE 24H (REMIND ME LATER)` invokes `handleDeferRating()`, setting `meme_capsule_rating_deferred_until = Date.now() + 86400000` and displaying a Neo-Brutalist confirmation toast (`RATING SNOOZED FOR 24 HOURS ⏰`).
- **Permanent Dismissal:**
  - Once the user rates the app or registers feedback, `meme_capsule_rating_completed` is set to `'true'` in `localStorage`. The rating prompt will NEVER display automatically again.
- **On-Demand Settings Action:**
  - Users can manually access the rating modal at any time via the "RATE ON PLAY STORE" button on the Settings screen.

### 3.11 Critical Engineering Guardrails & Styling Gotchas (Tailwind v4)
1. **Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme` Spacing Token Gotcha (`src/index.css`):**
   - `src/index.css` defines custom spacing tokens (`--spacing-xs: 8px`, `--spacing-sm: 16px`, `--spacing-md: 24px`, `--spacing-lg: 40px`, `--spacing-xl: 64px`).
   - In Tailwind CSS v4, utility classes like `max-w-md` or `max-w-sm` resolve to `var(--spacing-md)` (`24px`) and `var(--spacing-sm)` (`16px`).
   - **MANDATORY RULE:** Always use explicit pixel values (e.g., `max-w-[460px]`, `max-w-[500px]`, or inline `style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '460px' }}`) for modal and container widths rather than `max-w-md` or `max-w-sm`.
2. **Touch Events in Draggable Cards:** Always use `onPointerDown`/`onTouchStart` with debounce timestamp guards and `pointer-events-none` on SVG icons for overlay action buttons.
3. **Android Build Commands:** Run `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`), then `npm run build:android`, followed by `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`.

  - React Router DOM v7 (`^7.18.2`)
  - Motion v13 (`^13.4.0`) for fluid micro-interactions
  - Tailwind CSS v3.4 (`^3.4.19`) with PostCSS & Autoprefixer
  - TypeScript 6 (`~6.0.2`) with strict type checking
- **Deterministic Static Prerendering (`ReactSSRRenderer`):** 
  Uses `vite-plugin-prerender` with an in-process headless `ReactSSRRenderer` (leveraging `react-dom/server` and `react-router-dom/server`'s `StaticRouter`) to produce fully-baked, SEO-ready static HTML files for all 6 public routes (`/`, `/about`, `/team`, `/faq`, `/how-it-works`, `/privacy`).
- **Dynamic Route-Specific SEO Metadata Injection:** 
  During build-time prerendering, `ReactSSRRenderer` reads route configurations (`ROUTE_SEO`) and surgically injects route-specific `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `<link rel="canonical">`, Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`), and Twitter card metadata directly into each route's generated `index.html`. This ensures 100% crawl fidelity without relying on JavaScript hydration or client-side redirects (`404.html`).

### 4.2 Interactive Live Drop Preview Simulator & Quota Lockout Bumper

## 5. PART C: DEVELOPER / INTERNAL BACKEND & EDGE INFRASTRUCTURE

### 5.1 Serverless Edge Infrastructure (Cloudflare Pages Functions)
The backend is completely serverless, deployed on Cloudflare Pages (`https://meme-capsule-eww.pages.dev`):
- **`GET /api/random-meme` & `GET /api/memes/random`**: Fetches a random approved meme record from D1 with strict CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`). Honors optional `?nsfw=1` query parameter; defaults strictly to safe/filtered (`AND (m.is_nsfw IS NULL OR m.is_nsfw = 0)`).
- **`GET /api/daily-meme`**: Deterministically selects the curated daily meme based on the current UTC date. Honors optional `?nsfw=1` query parameter; defaults strictly to safe/filtered.
- **`PATCH /api/curate/nsfw`**: Dedicated curator endpoint for toggling `is_nsfw` and recording `nsfw_flagged_by = 'curator'`.
- **`POST /api/like`**: Atomically increments `likes_count` for a given meme ID in D1.
- **`POST /api/events`**: Ingests batched telemetry events into the D1 event queue.
- **`POST /api/report`**: Receives user safety reports and logs them in `meme_reports`.
- **`/reports`**: Serves the standalone HTML/CSS moderation dashboard for reviewing flagged content with non-destructive *Mark NSFW* support.
- **`/api/cat/*` & `/api/curate/*`**: Authenticated endpoints serving the multi-judge curation system.
- **`/api/admin/*`**: Token-protected administrative endpoints for storage syncing, SQL execution, and analytics management.

### 5.2 Cloudflare D1 Database Schemas, 3-Tier Partitioning & NSFW Flag Integration (Migrations 012 & 013)
Meme Capsule uses Cloudflare D1 (serverless SQLite). The database schema has evolved through 14 migration files (`d1/migrations/`).

#### The 3-Tier Partitioning Architecture (`curation_status`):
To prevent mixing rejected memes with uncurated backlog items, Migration 012 introduced the `curation_status` column on the `memes` table:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                            TOTAL CORPUS (5,111)                             │
├─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┤
│    ACTIVE (KEEP)        │      EXCLUDED           │     ARCHIVED (BACKLOG)  │
│       111 Memes         │       53 Memes          │       4,947 Memes       │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ • status: 'active'      │ • status: 'archived'    │ • status: 'archived'    │
│ • is_active: 1          │ • is_active: 0          │ • is_active: 0          │
│ • curation_status: keep │ • curation_status: excl │ • curation_status: NULL │
│ • Eligible for Public   │ • Ineligible for Public │ • Ineligible for Public │
│   Capsule drops         │ • Admin-visible (Red)   │ • Awaiting curator rev. │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

#### Core Database Tables:
1. **`memes` (Core Media Catalog):**
   - `id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier.
   - `url` (TEXT): Public URL in Cloudflare R2.
   - `storage_path` (TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE): R2 storage key.
   - `category` (TEXT): Primary humor category.
   - `tags` (TEXT): JSON array of string tags.
   - `rarity` (TEXT): Drop rarity (`Common`, `Rare`, `Epic`, `Legendary`).
   - `status` (TEXT): Lifecycle state (`active`, `archived`, `draft`).
   - `is_active` (INTEGER): Public delivery flag (1 = active, 0 = inactive).
   - `curation_status` (TEXT DEFAULT NULL): Editorial outcome (`keep`, `excluded`, `duplicate`, `review_later`, or `NULL` while pending). Added in Migration 012.
   - `duplicate_of` (TEXT), `topics` (TEXT JSON), `tone` (TEXT), and `humour_mechanisms` (TEXT JSON): Resolved curation fields added in Migration 014.
   - `is_nsfw` (INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0): 18+ content flag added in Migration 013 (`013_add_nsfw_flag.sql`). Gated on public delivery routes (`is_nsfw = 0` by default; requested via `?nsfw=1`). Indexed via `idx_memes_is_nsfw`.
   - `nsfw_flagged_by` (TEXT): Origin of NSFW flag (`'ai-judge'`, `'curator'`, `'report'`, or `NULL`). Added in Migration 013.
   - `random_key` (REAL): Indexed random selection helper (`abs(random()) / 9223372036854775807.0`).
   - `likes_count`, `shown_count`, `share_count` (INTEGER).
2. **`meme_curation` (Independent Judge Votes):**
   - Stores up to three independent human rows, one per `(meme_id, user_id)`, with `corpus_status`, `duplicate_of`, `topics`, `tone`, `humour_mechanisms`, `curator_note`, and timestamps. AI Judge 4/5 rows remain separate from human vote counts.
3. **`meme_curation_final` (SuperAdmin Authoritative Resolutions):**
   - Stores only authoritative `keep` and `excluded` outcomes. Duplicate and review_later outcomes are carried by `memes.curation_status`. It retains existing historical resolutions.
4. **`cat_users` (Curator Accounts):**
   - `username` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY), `password_hash` (SHA-256), `role` (`judge` or `superadmin`), `is_active` (INTEGER).
5. **`meme_reports` (Content Moderation Queue):**
   - `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT), `meme_id` (TEXT), `reason` (TEXT), `details` (TEXT), `status` (`pending`, `resolved`, `dismissed`), `created_at` (DATETIME).
6. **`content_blacklist` (Global Ban Registry):**
   - `meme_id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY), `reason` (TEXT), `created_at` (DATETIME).
7. **`meme_events` & `meme_analytics` (Telemetry & Rankings):**
   - Event queue and aggregated engagement/virality metrics.

### 5.3 Object Storage & Media Delivery (Cloudflare R2 Bucket `memes`)
- Media assets (WebP, JPEG, PNG, GIF, MP4) reside in Cloudflare R2 bucket `memes`.
- Serves content publicly with **zero egress bandwidth charges**, edge caching, and high availability.

### 5.4 Multi-Judge Consensus, AI-Judgement Review & Layer 0 Keyboard Curation (`/curate`, `/categorise`)
Designed for rapid, high-volume evaluation. Curators (Judges 1, 2, 3) review memes pre-evaluated by offline AI models (AI Judges 4 & 5):

**Multi-Judge Architecture & Strict Role Boundaries:**
- **Human Judges (Judges 1, 2, 3):** Authoritative consensus arbiters. Unanimous keep, unanimous exclude, duplicate convergence, and split/conflicts are governed **strictly and exclusively** by the three human judges.
- **AI Judges (Judges 4 & 5):** Assistive pre-evaluators designed to boost human curation velocity. **AI judges NEVER push conflicts, arguments, or blockers onto the SuperAdmin console, nor trigger arbitration states.** Their votes serve as reference context and instant adoption options ("⚡ ADOPT DECISION") for human judges.
- **Full 5-Judge Dashboard Visibility:** All 5 configured judges (Judges 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are permanently displayed in the SuperAdmin live progress strip and comparison tables.
- **Mandatory Exclude & Force-Remove Auditing:** Every judge's "Exclude" votes (`{j.excluded} Excl`) and "Force Remove" purges (`{j.force_removed} Purged`) are explicitly tallied and visibly rendered on the SuperAdmin dashboard. Every hard purge writes an immutable audit row to `meme_force_removals` prior to metadata/R2 deletion.
- **Zero Schema Drift Enforcement:** Edge queries must never reference newly introduced migration columns without physically verifying that the live D1 database has the column (preventing 500 error queue collapses).

**AI-Judgement Review Workflow for Human Judges (Judges 1, 2, 3):**
- **State A (AI Consensus):** When AI Judge 4 and AI Judge 5 agree (both Keep or both Exclude), the human judge can press `Space` or `Enter` to fast-approve the consensus in a single stroke. If taxonomy details differ, pressing `4` adopts Judge 4, pressing `5` adopts Judge 5, or `Space/Enter` adopts Judge 4 by default.
- **State B (AI Disagreement):** When AI Judge 4 and AI Judge 5 reach conflicting conclusions, both decisions are displayed side-by-side with hotkeys: `4` (Adopt Judge 4), `5` (Adopt Judge 5), or `O` (Manual Override).
- **Single AI Ready:** When only one AI has completed evaluation, human judges can press `Space` or `Enter` to instantly adopt the available evaluation without roadblock.
- **Three-Human Majority Finalization (`POST /api/curate/approve`):** Each human judge writes only their own vote. A meme remains in the queue for other judges until they vote; no other human vote is returned to regular judges. Finalization occurs after all three votes.
- **Layer 0 outcomes:** Keep and excluded finalize on 2:1 or 3:0 majorities. Duplicate finalizes only when its target converges. Review_later moves to its secondary queue. A 1:1:1 split or unresolved duplicate target routes to SuperAdmin. Only unanimous 3:0 excluded triggers hard Force Remove; 2:1 excluded is soft-archived.
- **Secondary-field consensus:** Topics and humour mechanisms are voted per taxonomy option, requiring 2 of 3 votes, capped at 3 and 2 with canonical-order tie breaks. Tone uses its 2-of-3 majority. If a field has no majority, use AI Judge 4's value, consistent with the existing AI tie-break.
- **Resolved fields:** Migration 014 adds `duplicate_of`, `topics`, `tone`, and `humour_mechanisms` to `memes`. `meme_curation_final` stores keep/excluded only; duplicate and review_later remain directly on `memes`. Kept memes preserve `tags = JSON.stringify(topics)` and `category = topics[0]`.
- **Force Remove (`Shift+Delete` / `POST /api/curate/force-remove`):** For non-meme / invalid media in the corpus, pressing `Shift+Delete` or clicking `FORCE REMOVE` permanently vanishes the file from R2 media storage, logs an immutable audit entry in `meme_force_removals`, and purges all records across D1 tables (`memes`, `meme_curation`, `meme_curation_final`, `ai_curation_predictions`, etc.). This destructive action is non-undoable.
- **Layer 0 Keyboard Curation (Override Mode `[O]`):**
  - `K`: **Keep** (Approved for public delivery).
  - `X`: **Exclude** (Archived; hidden from public drops).
  - `D`: **Duplicate** (Flag as duplicate with target ID).
  - `R`: **Review Later** (Deferred to secondary review queue).
  - `1-9, 0, -, =`: Toggle topic taxonomy (Max 3).
  - `Q, W, E, A, S, F`: Select humor tone (1 dominant).
  - `Z, C, V, B, N, M, J, P, O`: Select humor mechanisms (Max 2).
  - `Space / Enter`: Save & Advance.
  - `Esc`: Return from manual override to AI review view.
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` or `U`: Instant undo last curation decision.
- **Curator-Facing NSFW Toggle (`🔞 NSFW 18+`):** Located on the review stage bar next to `⚡ FORCE REMOVE`. Allows curators to independently flag or unflag content as NSFW (`PATCH /api/curate/nsfw`) without altering `corpus_status`, `meme_curation` audit votes, or Layer 0 keyboard shortcuts.


### 5.5 SuperAdmin Arbitration & Authoritative Active Synchronization
The SuperAdmin Command Center unresolved filter contains only complete three-human-vote arbitration cases: 1:1:1 Layer 0 splits or duplicate target divergence among Judges 1, 2, and 3. AI judges never introduce conflicts.
- **Keep:** Writes `meme_curation_final` with `corpus_status='keep'`, activates `memes`, and preserves resolved fields plus the existing tags/category mapping.
- **Excluded:** Writes `meme_curation_final` with `corpus_status='excluded'` and soft-archives the meme. Only unanimous 3:0 human exclusion calls the existing hard Force Remove path; a 2:1 excluded vote never hard-deletes.
- **Duplicate / Review Later:** Does not write `meme_curation_final`; stores outcome, duplicate target, and resolved fields directly on `memes`.
- **SuperAdmin KPI Metrics**: The Superadmin dashboard displays `ACTIVE RESOLVED`, `TOTAL EXCLUDE VOTES`, `FORCE REMOVED`, `HUMAN CONFLICTS`, `UNANIMOUS KEEP`, and `UNANIMOUS EXCLUDE`.
- **Judges Progress Strip**: Displays live review stats for all 5 judges, showing total reviewed, kept, exclude votes, duplicates, review later, and force removals.
- **Public Spawn Gating**: The public delivery APIs continue to require an inner join on `meme_curation_final` with `corpus_status = 'keep'`, ensuring only keep decisions can enter user capsule drops. Unfinalized, excluded, duplicate, and review_later memes remain excluded.

### 5.6 Admin Console, 5-Metric Status Bar & SQL Runner (`/admin`)
Token-protected control center (`ADMIN_API_TOKEN`):
- **Top Stats Bar:** Displays 5 core metrics plus 6th NSFW stat card:
  - `TOTAL`: **5111**
  - `ACTIVE`: **111**
  - `EXCLUDED`: **53** (High-contrast red card `#FF3B30`)
  - `ARCHIVED`: **4947** (Uncurated backlog)
  - `DRAFTS`: **0**
  - `NSFW`: **N** (High-contrast cyber pink card `#dd0061`)
- **Filter Tabs:** Includes `NSFW` filter tab alongside `ALL (5111)`, `ACTIVE (111)`, `EXCLUDED (53)`, `ARCHIVED (4947)`, and `DRAFT (0)`.
- **Row Presentation:** Excluded memes display a high-visibility red `EXCLUDED` badge and strikethrough title. Memes with `is_nsfw = 1` display a prominent cyber-pink `NSFW` badge.
- **R2 Storage Sync:** Scans R2 bucket, identifies unindexed media files, and inserts them into D1 as new meme candidates.
- **SQL Runner:** Allows administrators to execute raw SQLite queries directly against D1 with safety guards.
- **Analytics Management:** Triggers the recalculation engine and provides CSV/Excel export capabilities.

### 5.7 Token-Gated Safety Moderation & Blacklisting (`/reports`)
Standalone, token-protected dashboard rendering directly from `functions/reports.ts`:
- Lists all pending user reports from the mobile app.
- Previews the reported meme, reason (`NSFW`, `Hate Speech`, `Harassment`, `Copyright`), and reporter details.
- **Actions:**
  - *Dismiss:* Clears report as benign.
  - *Archive Meme:* Sets meme `status = 'archived'` in D1 (soft removal).
  - *Blacklist Meme:* Sets `status = 'archived'` AND permanently records the meme in `content_blacklist`.
  - *Mark NSFW:* When a report has `reason = 'NSFW'`, a non-destructive moderation action sets `is_nsfw = 1` and `nsfw_flagged_by = 'report'` on the meme without removing it from circulation, resolving the report.

### 5.8 Multimodal AI Pre-Curator Loop (`/ai-judge` & NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 Vision)
1. **Gemini Vision Pipeline (`/api/ai-judge/classify.ts`):** Multimodal Google Gemini Vision (`gemini-1.5-flash`) analyzes uploaded memes, extracting captions, evaluating humor mechanisms, and performing automated NSFW/toxicity screening. When NSFW screening returns a positive signal, it writes `is_nsfw = 1, nsfw_flagged_by = 'ai-judge'` directly to `memes`.
2. **NVIDIA NIM Python Runner (`categorise.py`):** An asynchronous worker passing images to **NVIDIA NIM (Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct)** to extract OCR text, score humor mechanisms (irony, absurdity, relatability), assign tone and topic, rate rarity, and perform automated toxicity/NSFW screening. When calling `/api/admin/ai-categorise`, positive screening results write `is_nsfw = 1, nsfw_flagged_by = 'ai-judge'` directly to `memes` at staging time instead of being discarded.

### 5.9 Telemetry Pipeline & Edge Ranking Recalculation Engine
- **Client Side:** Client actions (`view`, `skip`, `like`, `share`, `download`) are enqueued into a local circular buffer and flushed every 30 seconds to `POST /api/events`.
- **Edge Side:** Events are written into `meme_events` with timestamps and session identifiers.
- **Recalculation:** The recalculation worker aggregates events across time windows, computing:
  - *Engagement Score:* Weighted combination of likes, shares, and downloads against views.
  - *Virality Score:* Ratio of external shares to total views.
  - *Skip Rate:* Percentage of views lasting under 1.5 seconds.
  - *Percentile Rankings:* Normalized scoring used for internal editorial insight.

## 6. UNIFIED NEO-BRUTALIST DESIGN SYSTEM & DESIGN TOKENS

All three codebases share a unified **Neo-Brutalist Cyber-Arcade** design language:

```text

│ Box Shadows       │ Hard Offset 4px to 6px Geometric Block (No Blur)       │
└───────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Hard Contrast:** Eliminates subtle gradients and soft blurs in favor of stark, aggressive contrast.
- **Tactile Feedback:** Buttons physically shift (`translate-x-1 translate-y-1`) and shed their hard offset box shadows on active press, simulating a physical arcade button depress.
- **Typography:** Heavy uppercase `Anton` headings convey bold authority, supported by condensed `Oswald` body copy.

## 8. DISCREPANCY RECONCILIATION, KNOWN LIMITATIONS & RESOLVED ISSUES

### 8.1 Resolved Architectural Issues
1. **The 164 vs 111 SuperAdmin Discrepancy (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* Superadmin showed `AUTHORITATIVE RESOLVED (164)` summing both keep (111) and excluded (53), while `/admin` showed `111 Active`.
   - *Resolution:* Superadmin KPI card now displays `111` (in `#34C759` green) matching `/admin Active`, with a dedicated `53 EXCL` badge.
2. **Archived vs Excluded Ambiguity (RESOLVED - Migration 012):**
   - *Previous state:* Both excluded memes (53) and uncurated backlog items (4,947) were lumped together into `status = 'archived'`.
   - *Resolution:* Added `curation_status` column to `memes`. Backfilled `curation_status = 'keep'` (111), `'excluded'` (53), and `NULL` (4,947). Added dedicated `[EXCLUDED]` filter tab and red badge to `/admin`.
3. **Drift Between `status` and `is_active` (RESOLVED - Migration 011):**
   - *Previous state:* 11 rows had mismatched `status` and `is_active` flags.
   - *Resolution:* Enforced $\text{status} = \text{'active'} \iff \text{is\_active} = 1$ across all 5,111 memes.
4. **Placeholder Screenshots on `memecapsule.wtf` (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* External placeholder generator URLs (`via.placeholder.com`).
   - *Resolution:* Replaced with 5 authentic Android app screenshots in modern WebP + JPEG format with 3D tilt and lightbox zoom.
5. **SPA Subpage 404 Routing on GitHub Pages (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* Reloading `/about` or `/privacy` returned 404 errors.
   - *Resolution:* Added `vite-plugin-prerender` with deterministic `ReactSSRRenderer` and a fallback `privacy.html`.
6. **Card Touch Responsiveness During Gestures (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* Touch clicks on card buttons were swallowed by `@use-gesture/react`.
   - *Resolution:* Switched overlay buttons to `onPointerDown`/`onTouchStart` with debounce timestamp guards and `pointer-events-none` on SVG icons.
7. **Service Worker Clashing in Android WebView (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* Old `sw.js` caused `Failed to fetch` errors inside Capacitor WebViews.
   - *Resolution:* Service worker registration was explicitly disabled in the mobile client.

### 8.2 Critical Engineering Constraints
1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Spacing Token Collision:**
   - In Tailwind CSS v4, custom `--spacing-*` tokens cause classes like `max-w-md` to resolve to `24px` instead of `28rem`. Always use explicit pixel widths (e.g. `max-w-[460px]`).
2. **Public Spawn Inner Join Requirement:**
   - Public APIs (`/api/random-meme`, `/api/daily-meme`) MUST enforce `INNER JOIN meme_curation_final f ON m.id = f.meme_id WHERE f.corpus_status = 'keep'`. Never bypass this gate.
3. **Zero Runtime Permissions on Android 10+:**
   - Media downloads must continue using Android `MediaStore.Images.Media` via the native Java bridge. Do not request legacy `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions.

## 10. CONTENT STRATEGY, ONE-LINERS & COPY KIT

### 10.1 Short & Punchy One-Liners
- **Under 10 Words:** Random memes. One tap. Zero algorithms.
- **Under 30 Words:** Meme Capsule is a free Android app that delivers hand-curated random memes with one tap. No feed, no algorithm, just pure meme chaos.
- **Under 80 Words:** Meme Capsule is an anti-algorithm entertainment app for Android that delivers hand-curated memes from a library of thousands of vetted images, supplemented by an auxiliary Reddit stream. Users tap one button to open a capsule — there is no algorithm, no tracking, and no endless scrolling. Memes can be saved to a personal offline vault, organized into mood boards, shared to any messaging app, or downloaded directly to the phone gallery.

### 10.2 Technical Pitch (For Developers / AI Agents)
> *Meme Capsule is a cross-platform content delivery ecosystem combining a Capacitor 8 native Android application (featuring a zero-permission Java MediaStore bridge and 4-card 3D perspective spring stack), a Cloudflare Pages serverless edge backend querying Cloudflare D1 SQLite and R2 object storage with zero egress fees and 3-tier status partitioning, a multimodal vision AI pre-judging pipeline (Gemini Vision and NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 11B Vision), and a multi-page neo-brutalist React web presence with deterministic static prerendering.*

ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE:
1. PUBLIC MOBILE APP (com.meme.capsule - v3.6 / versionCode 27):
   - Tech: React 19, TypeScript, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS v4, Capacitor 8 Android container.
   - Core UX: 4-card 3D perspective spring deck (@react-spring/web, @use-gesture/react), 12-meme rolling FIFO prefetch buffer (STACK_BATCH_SIZE = 10, PIPELINE_TARGET_SIZE = 12) with 60%-70% stack consumption prefetch trigger (STACK_PREFETCH_CONSUMPTION_RATIO = 0.6 / FIFO_REFILL_TRIGGER_SIZE = 4) and streaming per-meme enqueueing (enqueueMemeToFifo + advanceInlineWithoutLoadingScreen so viewing flow never breaks with a full-screen loading screen), zero floating action buttons over the Meme Box, and horizontal 4-column CTA row (nav#ctaRow, max-w-[356px] w-full mt-3.5) directly below the Meme Box: LIKE (#FF2A85) -> VAULT (#A855F7) -> PIN (#FACC15) -> MORE (⋮) (#00E5FF) with translate(3px, 3px) active press, ink-spread ripple (@keyframes inkSpread), 6-tick radial shockwave bursts (@keyframes burstSparks), and pop icon animations (@keyframes neoBurst). Tapping MORE opens #moreMenu (w-48 bg-white border-4 border-black) containing SHARE (#A855F7), DOWNLOAD (#FACC15), and REPORT (#FF2A85).
   - Google Play Rating Feature (RatingModal.tsx - v3.6): Interval-based rating prompt (first triggers at >= 8 memes viewed, then every 15 memes). Features a Neo-Brutalist 5-star interactive rating deck with dynamic reaction labels ("GOD-TIER DANKNESS!", "CERTIFIED BANGERS!", etc.). Redirects to Google Play Store via native bridge `openPlayStoreListing()` (`market://details?id=com.meme.capsule` with fallback to `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meme.capsule`) and sets `meme_capsule_rating_completed = 'true'` so it permanently never pops up again once feedback is registered. Provides a 24-hour deferral option (`REMIND ME IN 24 HOURS`) setting `meme_capsule_rating_deferred_until`. Also includes a manual trigger button in App Settings under "MEMBERSHIP & APP GUIDE".
   - Smart Session Lifecycle (Background App-Switch Retention vs Cold-Start Homepage Reset - v3.2): Uses `sessionStorage` (`meme_capsule_active_session_v1`), a short-lived 2-minute external share handoff token (`meme_capsule_share_handoff_v1`), and native Android process/task state detection (`window.MemeCapsuleAndroid.shouldRestoreRunningSession()` + `meme-capsule-reset-to-home` in `MainActivity.java`). Switching between running apps or sharing to external apps preserves the exact loaded meme and 12-meme FIFO queue, whereas removing/closing the app from running background applications in Android Recents and reopening it starts fresh on the Homepage (`screen = 'waiting'`, `activeTab = 'home'`).
   - Top-Left Header & Settings Dismissal: Removed the leaf/seed badge (🌱 1) from the top-left header and replaced it with a redesigned Neo-Brutalist Settings icon button (#1c1c1e / #A855F7, 2px solid #000, 2.5px 2.5px 0px #000). Replaced the redundant large gear square on the top right of APP SETTINGS with a Neo-Brutalist [X] Close Button, and enabled top-left header re-tap toggle, backdrop tap-to-dismiss, and Android hardware back dismissal.
   - Viral Sharing: Persistent Share Sheet Ribbon sits 100% flush (0px breathing space) on the top border of the 3-tab bottom navigation dock (bottom: calc(60px + max(env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px), 16px))). Expands smoothly over 320ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) from behind the dock, supports Instagram-style 0-latency 1:1 finger drag-to-dismiss (26% height / 0.5px/ms velocity threshold), and removes both the 5 technical/debug labels and the visible dark promotional text preview box from the frontend while preserving 100% of the promotional message + Play Store link payload on clipboard and share intents.
   - Native Java: MainActivity.java injects "window.MemeCapsuleAndroid" for Scoped MediaStore gallery saving (Pictures/Meme Capsule), Play Store listing intent (openPlayStoreListing), and targeted intent sharing (shareImageToApp).
   - Collections, Settings & Monetization: Meme Vault (free limit 20, Pro unlimited), Mood Boards, dedicated Settings & History page (Privacy Policy v1.1, 4 granular history/data erasure controls, feed/buffer/shake toggles), AdMob interstitials (every 4th drop), In-App Purchase (₹99 remove_ads_forever).

2. PUBLIC WEB PLATFORM (memecapsule.wtf):
   - Tech: React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS v3, React Router DOM v6, static HTML prerendering (vite-plugin-prerender with ReactSSRRenderer) on GitHub Pages.
   - Core Features: Live Drop Simulator (5-drop quota + lockout bumper with Play Store UTM tracking), 3D interactive phone mockups (5 authentic WebP captures + lightbox zoom), Kage atmospheric UI (Preloader, CustomCursor, GrainOverlay, Vignette, ScrollRail), Acid Glitch mode (html.theme-glitch), Section 04.5 Under the Hood, /about Press Kit (copy kit & brand downloads), /privacy policy, Formspree contact form (xwlenwzr with privacy consent), Google AdSense unit meme1 (slot 6291908699, ca-pub-2093403233028868), and SEO/GEO (llms.txt, Schema.org).

3. SERVERLESS EDGE BACKEND & INTERNAL WORKBENCHES (meme-capsule-eww.pages.dev - This Repo):
   - Tech: Cloudflare Pages Functions, Cloudflare D1 (SQLite with 13 migrations), Cloudflare R2 (bucket memes, $0.00 egress).
   - 3-Tier Status Partitioning (Migration 012):
     * curation_status = 'keep' (111 memes, status = 'active', is_active = 1) -> Live in public Capsule drops.
     * curation_status = 'excluded' (53 memes, status = 'archived', is_active = 0) -> Authoritatively rejected by Superadmin.
     * curation_status IS NULL (4,947 memes, status = 'archived', is_active = 0) -> Uncurated backlog.
     * Total Corpus: 5,111 memes.
   - Internal Tools (Neo-Brutalist dark theme #121212, Anton/Oswald fonts):
     * /curate & /categorise: Multi-judge consensus curation with Layer 0 keyboard shortcuts (K, E, D, L) and SuperAdmin conflict arbitration.
     * /admin: 5-metric status bar (Total 5111, Active 111, Excluded 53, Archived 4947, Drafts 0), dedicated [EXCLUDED] filter tab, D1/R2 sync, SQL runner, analytics recalculation.
     * /reports: Token-gated moderation dashboard for user-flagged memes (archive / blacklist).
     * /ai-judge: Multimodal vision loop (Gemini Vision + NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 Vision runner) for pre-curation recommendations.
   - Note: Old pastel root landing UI (App.tsx, styles.css) has been REMOVED. Default route / serves <CurateApp />.

CRITICAL RULES & CONSTRAINTS:
1. STRICT INTEGRITY: The public spawn query strictly requires INNER JOIN on meme_curation_final WHERE corpus_status = 'keep'. Unfinalized or excluded memes must never spawn.
2. NO ALGORITHMS: The public delivery philosophy is anti-algorithmic serendipity. Never add recommendation algorithms.
3. TAILWIND V4 GOTCHA: In Tailwind v4, custom --spacing-* tokens cause max-w-md to resolve to 24px. Always use explicit pixel widths (e.g. max-w-[460px]).
4. CLEAR CODEBASE BOUNDARIES: Maintain strict separation between Mobile APK, Promo Web, and Edge Backend.
