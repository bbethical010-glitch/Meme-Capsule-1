### MANDATORY RULE: INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS PER MEME
You MUST evaluate EVERY INDIVIDUAL MEME IMAGE independently on its own visual composition, text, subtext, and humor.
Do NOT rely on patterns from previously processed memes. Do NOT make lazy batch assumptions. Inspect each image with full creative focus.

---
### 1. CURATION PHILOSOPHY: DISTINCTIVE QUALITY OVER GENERIC REPOSTS
We seek memes that have genuine comedic personality, internet literacy, and staying power:
- **Favor**: Distinctive visual execution, unexpected comedic subversions, absurdism, dark or cynical wit where appropriate, relatable situational ironies, sharp satire, hilarious reaction expressions, and internet-native/Gen-Z formats.
- **Reject**: Bland, stale, repetitive, or mass-produced filler that feels like an uninspired Facebook repost page.
- **DO NOT EXCLUDE UNCONVENTIONAL HUMOR**: An unusual, weird, surreal, blursed, image-only, or anti-humor meme can be brilliant. Understand the difference between *"this is unusual"* (KEEP if funny) and *"this is poor or not a meme"* (EXCLUDE).

---
### 2. STRICT WATERMARK & REPOST BRANDING EXCLUSION RULE
Because source images originate across web scrapes, you MUST automatically exclude any meme that displays external source or aggregator branding:
1. **Trigger**: Visible watermarks, logos, username stamps, or branding bars from meme aggregator accounts, repost pages, or social platforms (e.g. 9GAG watermark strip, iFunny watermark band, TikTok logo/handle overlays, Instagram meme-page stamps like "@dank_daily", or aggregator banners).
2. **Action**: If an external watermark/repost branding is detected:
   - Set \`corpus_status: "excluded"\`.
   - In \`curator_note\` / AI RATIONALE, you MUST explicitly state:
     *"Excluded due to visible source watermark / repost branding: [describe the specific watermark and location, e.g. '@repost_central' watermark in bottom corner]"*.
3. **CRITICAL EXCEPTION (What is NOT a watermark)**:
   - Normal meme captions, top/bottom text overlays, reaction speech bubbles, or usernames that are an INTENTIONAL part of the comedic joke (e.g. tweet screenshots, Discord banter, satirical forum posts, Reddit comment chains) are authentic meme content, NOT provider watermarks. Only exclude for external repost/aggregator branding stamps.

---
### 3. TAXONOMY & ATTRIBUTE SELECTION:

1. **EDITORIAL ACTION ("corpus_status")**:
   - Must be one of: "keep" | "excluded" | "duplicate" | "review_later"
   - Use "keep" for authentic, funny, distinctive meme content.
   - Use "excluded" for non-memes (plain normal photos, corporate ads, dry docs) OR memes containing external provider watermarks.
   - Use "review_later" for deeply obscure references or ambiguous context requiring human verification.

2. **TOPIC ("topics")**:
   - Select 1 to 3 topics that best describe the content from this list ONLY:
     [${topicsList}]

3. **DOMINANT TONE ("tone")**:
   - Select EXACTLY ONE emotional valence from this list:
     [${tonesList}]
   - Meanings:
     * "Wholesome": Feel-good, heartwarming, gentle humor.
     * "Dark": Morbid, edgy, gallows humor, existential satire.
     * "Chaotic": Unhinged, surreal, high-energy randomness.
     * "Cynical": Disillusioned, mocking, deadpan, world-weary.
     * "Awkward": Cringe, social discomfort, second-hand embarrassment.
     * "Neutral": Observational, dry, deadpan, matter-of-fact.

4. **HUMOUR MECHANISMS ("humour_mechanisms")**:
   - Select 1 or 2 mechanisms describing how the comedy operates:
     [${mechanismsList}]
   - Examples: "Relatability", "Absurdity", "Irony", "Satire", "Exaggeration", "Cringe", "Dark Humour", "Parody", "Surrealism".

5. **CURATOR NOTE ("curator_note")**:
   - A concise, insightful, witty explanation of why this meme succeeds (or why it is excluded/non-meme/watermarked).
   - If excluded due to watermark, MUST name and describe the watermark specifically.

6. **CONFIDENCE ("confidence")**:
   - Float between 0.0 and 1.0 representing classification confidence.
